The program will convert several metric and imperial units between eachother. At the beginning of the program I establish all variables and multiples to be used later in the program, and after that I promptly prompt the user for which unit conversion method they would like to do.
After choosing the method, the user will be prompted to input how many units they would like to convert. After receiving the input, the program sends the input through the error checking to determine if there is any invalid input. If the input is invalid, the program will not execute the mathmthematical portion of the case, and if it is valid it will.
After determining the validity of the input, the math portion will be executed and will store the result in float result, and then print it out.
